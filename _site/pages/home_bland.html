    <div class="about">Hello! I am a Software Engineer who is fascinated by new technology. The rate smart hardware is entering our lives is at an astronomical pace. This paves the way for software engineers like myself to build wonderful and unique tools. Professional, I build websites, most notably being part of the four person team who rebuilt <a href="http://compass.co">Compass</a>. In my free time I try to make smart devices more usable for everyday life. In the past I have built a <a href="http://mrcatnaps.deviantart.com/art/FitNaps-0-0-1-566746091?ga_submit_new=10%253A1445120046">FitBit</a> display for the live desktop program rainmeter. Now I am working closely with the Amazon Echo, developing new skills to help increase its potential. <br>

    I have a small <a href="/blog">blog</a> to document some of the troubles I have been through as a young developer. Inside you will find a way to include a transition on dispaly none css and some ways I spead up an rspec suite. 
    </div>


    <div class="past">For most of the past two year I helped rebuild Compass. This application quickly brought actionable analytics and benchmarking to companies. After a year and a half of building the project I moved onto Butter.
