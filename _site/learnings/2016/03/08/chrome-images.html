  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>If you have read my past blog posts, I have been working on quickly updating the <a href="/cannabis#/kasper">cannabis</a> section of my blog with images. My earlier blog posts contain issues I had with getting the image file names, but after I solved that I ran into a different issue. Displaying 50 - 100 pictures on a page take from a 12mp camera.</p>

<p>The main issue as I am sure you guess is it is <strong>slow</strong>!</p>

<p>First I decided the quality I was displaying was way too high. Some of the files were 3mb+, loading 150mb+ on a page was disastrous. I used <strong>https://tinyjpg.com/</strong> to easily batch shrink all my files a ton. However, even after shrinking the folder by more than 50% it was still too slow.</p>

<p>Second was figure out why all the images were rendering slowly, when I was getting the names from github api within 100ms. A quick search into angularjs shows that ng-repeat was a culprit. It apparently is not indexed and the list elements are removed when out of view. By adding an index using <strong>track by</strong> the ng-repeat was much faster.</p>

<p>Third there was an issue with enlarging the images. The css <strong>focus</strong> class was not working inside of chrome, so I couldn’t select an image out of a list. In google chrome the list elements must have a <strong>&lt;div tabindex=”1”</strong>. This will allow the css <strong>focus</strong> class to work and allow for tabbing through the images.</p>
