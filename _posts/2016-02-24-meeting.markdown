1] Ruby encoding defaults to ASCII, which is an issue when importing files with non ASCII characters.

 - If you import a file which you do not know the encoding, you can use the *valid_encoding?* method which will return a boolean.

2] To increase concurrent speed in Ruby it is better to increase processes rather than increase threads.

 - All Ruby threads are passed through a global lock, shoving more threads through the lock will bottleneck quickly.
 - Creating more processes will produce more locks which shouldn't have significant bottlenecks.

3] Gmail tricks for signing up multiple accounts to a single email:

 - Gmail ignores periods, for @gmail accounts

  mr.catnaps@gmail.com and mr.cat.naps@gmail.com will both work
 - Anything after a + sign is ignored, but recored in the 'To'

  mrcatnaps+subscription@gmail.com will go to mrcatnaps@gmail.com
 - Capitalization is ignored by Gmail for all accounts (business and personal)

  mrCATnaps@gmail.com is the same as mrcatNAPS@gmail.com
